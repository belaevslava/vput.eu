                    Removal of offers from the website does not affect already completed bookings and does not relieve the

                    V.P.U.T. is an online platform, where Users can be both individuals and legal entities; the property
                    owners or their representatives. Representatives of a legal entity ensure that they have the authority
                    to bind the company on whose behalf they act to the terms of this Agreement.

                <p>
                    V.P.U.T. provides advertising services and assists all website Users in communication, reservation and
                    implementation of secure payment. The platform Users have an opportunity to post free ads about renting
                    their property and advertise it to the website visitors. The User that posted one or more ads about
                    housing rental who is the owner or the authorized representative of the owner is called the Landlord or
                    the Owner. He guarantees that he has a legal right to provide the housing for rent mentioned in the ad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only the Landlord is responsible for the content of this ad and for the fact that he has the appropriate
                    license and registration. V.P.U.T. is unable to confirm the accuracy of the content of the published by
                    the Landlord advertisements, to verify the provided information, as well as the Landlord's right to
                    manage the property. The Company is not the rental property owner, nor the representative of a
                    management company; therefore, the Landlord is solely responsible for the relevance of the information,
                    the quality and condition of the rented housing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The User who placed the order and booked accommodation via the website is called the Renter or the

                </p>
                <p>
                    The rental agreement is concluded directly between the Landlord and the Renter. V.P.U.T. is not a third
                    party in such agreement, it does not control the parties, and therefore, is not liable for complying
                    with the terms of the contract and its execution by the parties. The User agrees that the Company shall
                    not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from the transaction. The User uses the platform V.P.U.T.
                    at his own risk. Any claims about housing operations can be addressed only to the Landlord, and not to
                    the Company. The Company is not responsible for the Users’ actions through the website or resulting from
                    the use of the website.

                <p>
                    Given the limited possibilities to verify the truthfulness of information, the User consents to
                    independently ascertain the veracity of the information provided by the Landlord. We strongly encourage
                    Guests to do everything they consider appropriate to check all details regarding the property with the
                    Landlord prior to the reservation, which is possible due to the provided opportunity to communicate
                    through correspondence directly with the Owner and clarify all the nuances. The Company can explore,
                    monitor and analyse correspondence between Users for the purpose of fraud prevention, investigations,
                    and to avoid sharing contact information and links to other websites.

                    <br>
                    The Landlord and the Guest are responsible for ensuring the legality of the rental process by following

                <p>
                    V.P.U.T. requires Landlords to describe the property truthfully and honestly. The Company does
                    everything in its power to eliminate the problems and responds to any complaint of the Renter. Real
                    reviews provided by vacationers can serve as a tool of control over the adequacy of ads and weeding out
                    of unscrupulous Landlords. Therefore, V.P.U.T. encourages all Renters to leave their honest feedback and
                    impressions about the property. The User agrees to provide only the facts in his reviews. Expressed
                    opinion should be objective, honest and informative. Users should not post reviews about their own
                    property, as well as provide information irrelevant to the booking, the process of signing the rental
                    agreement or staying in the provided housing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    V.P.U.T. does not change or edit reviews. The User cannot edit an already published review as well.
                    After the publication on the Website, reviews are available to all Users. Any feedback posted on the
                    Website, shall remain public even after the disabling of the account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only the User bears whole responsibility for the reviews for which criminal or administrative liability
                    is provided (racist and hate speech, offensive comments, etc.) and only he can be held legally
                    responsible for the damage to the business reputation of the other side. In such cases, V.P.U.T. is not
                    legally responsible for the situation, as the Company does not verify the adequacy of the posted reviews
                    and the Company's opinion may not coincide with the opinion of the User. In certain cases, V.P.U.T. has
                    the right to remove a review as an exception if it contradicts the interests of the Company or other
                    Users. The User must not include in his reviews his or other User’s personal and contact information,
                    links and scripts. Such reviews will be deleted without notice.

                <p>
                    The ad published by the Landlord about the housing for rent and containing the description of
                    accommodations is a public offer. In order for the said offer to be considered accepted by the User and
                    the rental agreement - concluded between the two parties, the following is required:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the Renter and the Landlord have agreed on the terms and conditions of stay, the cost of rent for
                        the entire period, and possible additional issues, in particular, non-refundable deposit, rental
                        security deposit, check-in and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>the Landlord <i><u>has confirmed</u></i> the booking and issued an invoice.</li>
                    <li>the reservation has been paid by the Renter and the Landlord receives a notice in the form of email
                        from V.P.U.T. confirming that. In the absence of such notice, the agreement between the Landlord and
                        the Renter shall not enter into force and, as a consequence, the obligations of the parties do not
                        come into force either.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Or</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the Renter has paid for the booking on the terms that the Landlord provided while posting the
                        offer.
                    </li>
                    <li>the Landlord has confirmed the booking and accepted the prepayment, and the Renter receives a notice
                        in the form of email from V.P.U.T. confirming that. In the absence of such notice, the agreement
                        between the Landlord and the Renter shall not enter into force and, as a consequence, the
                        obligations of the parties do not come into force either.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    For the Renter the total payment amount noted in the booking is equal to the total rent for the agreed
                    number of nights and the price for final cleaning. Such issues as security deposit, additional equipment
                    for the housing and other services provided by the Landlord do not apply to V.P.U.T. terms of User
                    Agreement, and they should be discussed and agreed by the Users themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Renter who received a confirmed booking from the Landlord is obliged to pay it within 48 hours from
                    the time of booking confirmation. Unpaid within the specified time, the reservation will be cancelled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The total rental cost pre-arranged by the Users is final. The Landlord has no right to increase the
                    price for accommodation after the payment of the reservation. Also, the Landlord does not have the right
                    to charge additional payments as a prepayment before settling in the Guest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The obligation to pay utility payments for the rented property is entrusted to the Landlord, unless
                    otherwise agreed between the parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Landlords can include in their ads a security deposit to ensure the preservation of the property
                    available for rent. If there is a need to pay such security deposit, the Renter shall pay the agreed
                    amount of the security deposit directly to the Landlord when checking into booked accommodation.
                    V.P.U.T. is not responsible for all the actions associated with the security deposit, because the
                    Company does not accept security deposits from Renters.

                    To make a payment, the Renter may take the opportunity to pay directly on the website V.P.U.T. using his
                    bank card or bank transfer. If the User chooses to pay by his bank card, he will be automatically
                    transferred to the webpage of the bank that will handle the payment; therefore, all the data of the card
                    and its holder will not be available and, accordingly, will not be saved or copied into any database of
                    our Company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All prices on the website are provided in Euro and include VAT. Before he makes a full or partial
                    payment with the possibility to pay the rest when checking in, the Renter sees the final amount of all
                    fees and commissions. The Company V.P.U.T. can not and shall not charge any other surcharges, fees or
                    commissions. After the payment, all the information, namely general description of the property, dates
                    of arrival and departure, the amount already paid, the amount of after-payment (if any), the amount of
                    non-refundable deposit, the amount of the security deposit, is automatically sent to the e-mail address
                    of the Renter and the Landlord – it is the official confirmation of the transaction and the guidance in
                    the event of any disputes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Renter has the right within 24 hours of arrival at the booked accommodation to declare the desire to
                    terminate the deal and get his money back if, when the property has been transferred at his disposal,
                    the terms and conditions of the rental agreement have not been fulfilled or if the accommodation does
                    not match the description posted on the website (but not the subjective expectations of the Renter). In
                    such situation, the Renter should inform V.P.U.T. within 24 hours about occurred problems at
                    <a href="mailto: info@vput.eu">info@vput.eu</a> and declare the intention to cancel the reservation indicating the reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    V.P.U.T. reserves the right of final decision in such situations. In case the Renter is right, all the
                    money will be refunded to him in the same way that it was paid within 20 business days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the conclusion of the rental agreement between the parties and provided that within 24 hours after
                    the Renter has arrived he has no objective claims regarding the accommodation, V.P.U.T. sends the money
                    to the account of the Landlord by bank transfer.
